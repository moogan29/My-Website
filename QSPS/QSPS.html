    <!-- TEXT ABOVE ESSAY -->
    <h2 class="Text">
      This was my final development project for the third year of my bachelor's degree (2024/2025). 
      I had complete freedom in choosing the topic, 
      which gave me the opportunity to explore a subject I’m deeply passionate about. 
      It marked my first in-depth experience with quantum computation, a field I’ve been eager to dive into. 
    </h2>
    <h2 class="Text">
      This is the submitted version of my final essay, which earned a first-class grade from both of my professors, 
      Eerke Boiten and Shengxiang Yang. The project explores the use of the QuTiP library (Quantum Toolbox in Python) 
      to simulate and visualize quantum behaviors in physical systems. I found the process deeply rewarding, as I was 
      learning the material in real time—tackling entirely new concepts and articulating them in a way that others could grasp. 
      It was a true embodiment of Einstein’s idea: “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” 
      My hope is that this paper serves as a gateway for fellow computer scientists into the world of quantum computation. 
      While the focus is primarily on the underlying mathematics and physics, the programming remains intentionally 
      accessible. Though the paper is not without its imperfections, I look forward to refining and completing it.

    <!-- <h2 class="Text">
      Below, you will find folders containing the fully developed Python scripts and the graphs 
      generated included in my essay as results. Overall there were 7 seperate python scripts, and 78 graphs. 
    </h2>
 -->
<h2 class="Text">
      These seven buttons link to the individual Python scripts and the full sets of generated results - a total of 78 visualizations comprising both XY graphs and Bloch sphere representations.
Each script corresponds to a specific quantum scenario explored in the essay above, and together they demonstrate the dynamic behavior of qubit states under different Hamiltonians and initial conditions.
The accompanying plots provide visual insight into probability oscillations, quantum state trajectories, and Bloch sphere evolution, which are discussed extensively throughout the essay.
