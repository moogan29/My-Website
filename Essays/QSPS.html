    <!-- TEXT ABOVE ESSAY -->
    <h2 class="Text">
      This was my final development project for the third year of my bachelor's degree (2024/2025). 
      I had complete freedom in choosing the topic, 
      which gave me the opportunity to explore a subject I’m deeply passionate about. 
      It marked my first in-depth experience with quantum computation, a field I’ve been eager to dive into. 
    </h2>
    <h2 class="Text">
      This is the submitted version of my final essay, which earned a first-class grade from both of my professors, 
      Eerke Boiten and Shengxiang Yang. The project explores the use of the QuTiP library (Quantum Toolbox in Python) 
      to simulate and visualize quantum behaviors in physical systems. I found the process deeply rewarding, as I was 
      learning the material in real time—tackling entirely new concepts and articulating them in a way that others could grasp. 
      It was a true embodiment of Einstein’s idea: “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” 
      My hope is that this paper serves as a gateway for fellow computer scientists into the world of quantum computation. 
      While the focus is primarily on the underlying mathematics and physics, the programming remains intentionally 
      accessible. Though the paper is not without its imperfections, I look forward to refining and completing it.
